# Word Guessing Game: Malayalam Movie Edition
This is a simple word guessing game where you try to guess the names of Malayalam movies (I've included only 5). Each movie title is hidden, and you guess one letter at a time.

Correct guesses reveal the letter in the word.

Incorrect guesses reduce your remaining attempts.

If your attempts drop to 0 before guessing the full title, you lose!

Try your best to guess all five movie names before running out of attempts!
